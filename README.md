## Overview
Bikesharing has become an exciting, magical, memory-creating, community-building activity that would be a lucrative addition to the city of Des Moines Iowa-Both, financially, economically, and virtuously. Kate has an investor who’s all ears in exploring how bikesharing works, and is interested in a business proposal. In building on our data analytics experience, this exercise is an introduction to high-level data visualizations with Tableau software. Data will be imported, related, and styled into visual analyses. The illustrations will then, further be used to present the prospectuses in 3 separated means of presentation: Worksheets, Dashboards, and Stories.

## Summary: Create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC CItibike analysis

Some key outcomes derived from Citibike analysis is 
- The MALE-gender makes up the greater population of the CitiBike customer base.
- The MALE-gender makes up the greater population of the subscriber base
- Most of the trips are started and ended along the Bay Area
- Customers like to ride, for an average of 4-6 hrs
- The peak days of the week to ride is Thursday -Saturday
- The UNKNOWN gender data is hard to target without being able to identify them.  

Tableau allows Data Analysts professionals to create visualizations that are assets and are visually appealing and easy for a non-technical audience to understand. The CitiBike proposal can now be comprehended with ease just by interpreting the visualization and reading key notes. In additional study, visualizations depicting the following studies would really add an attractive kick for the business proposal 

- The volume of Top start location by weekday vs the Top volume of ending locations by weekday. The study would allow allocation of resources where most needed. And will encourage planning of shipping logistic to cover supply and demand.
- Subscribers' parameters by month: the number of rides by user id, and by gender, to be able to predict likeness of non-subscriber customer conversion to subscriber and to develop possible promotional efforts to influence subscriptions.
